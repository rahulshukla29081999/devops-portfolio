## 🚀 Deployment (AWS Amplify)

High-level deployment flow:
1. Code pushed to GitHub repository
2. AWS Amplify connected to GitHub
3. Automatic build & deploy on every push
4. Custom domain attached and verified via DNS
5. HTTPS enabled by default through Amplify

This setup simulates a **real-world CI/CD style workflow** for static applications.
